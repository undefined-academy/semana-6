        I am a bioengineer with experience working as a database administrator for one and a half years, managing Oracle and SQL Server database engines. 
        Additionally, I have worked as a mainframe developer for another one and a half years. Currently, I have been working as a Salesforce developer for a year, 
        where I create classes in Apex, controllers, and LWC (Lightning Web Components). I have knowledge in Javascript, React, Node.js, and NextJS.
